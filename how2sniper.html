								<p class="sit">The long range Australian assassins of Team Fortress 2. Snipers generally play the role of support but a skilled sniper can play effective offense <i>and</i> defense. Armed with his infamous Sniper Rifle, he can plug bullets into anyone's head and stop any opposing threat. Alongside is his S.M.G., which helps him hold up enough health to land a final blow with his Kukri, useful for chopping up Spies.</p>

									<b>Know your tools to survival.</b></p>
								<p class="sit">Every Sniper starts with three stock weapons: a Sniper rifle (Primary), a mid-ranged SMG (Secondary) and his backup Kukri (Melee). Alongside those are other weapons you can obtain through achievements and item drops. The following tables will go over the best (in my opinion) weapons you can have.</p>

								<h3 class="headStuff">Know your Sniper Rifle.</h3>
								<p class="sit">The Sniper Rifle is a powerful weapon with and its main use is for picking off enemies at a good distance. This weapon is very powerful and can be lethal with one shot. Remember, aim for the head of your enemies.</p>
								
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								
								<h3 class="headStuff">Get your Technique Down.</h3>
								<p class="sit">You should generally stay unscoped and avoid staying zoomed in. This is so that you can be more aware and observe the battlefield. Additionally, scoping will limit your sight and decrease your movement speed. Staying unscoped, you can use any of the four techniques below, elaborated on in a few moments: No Scoping, Hard Scoping, Strafe Scoping and Quickscoping.</p>
							
								<br />
								
								<ul class="bulletStuff">
									<li>No Scoping, also known as hip-firing, is firing the gun without zoom, from the hip, and is useful to pick off any close or fast moving enemies, such as scouts. If you think that scoping is dangerous in a situation, you can help your team out and fire from the hip to potentially assist in killing any enemies.</li>
									<li>The longer you are zoomed in, the more damage your shots can do. A meter will charge. When it is full, you will do the most damage. Camping can be done by aiming at an entrance and waiting for an enemy to walk into your crosshair. When you're zoomed in, a dot will show on whatever you are aiming at. Your enemies may see this and avoid your shot. You may want to aim a bit to the side where the dot is not visible and then swiftly move your aim towards the enemy to surprise them. Hard Scoping may be effective, but it is frowned upon by more experienced players, especially enemy snipers, since it takes the least skill.</li>
									<li>Strafe-scoping is taking advantage of strafing (moving left and right with the A and D keys) while keeping your crosshair at the level of enemy heads to assist aiming. This technique is great against enemies while on flat surfaces. Most players keep their crosshair at head level and zoom in only when it is near an enemy.</li>
									<li>Quickscoping is taking advantage of good muscle memory and is the technique used by pros. At the sight of an enemy, quickly move your crosshair towards the enemy's head and zoom in. As you right click, quickly slide your mouse towards the enemy's head. It helps you use your mouse in conjunction with the A and D keys (strafing) to help increase accuracy. It takes time to pick up quickscoping but once you know how to do it, it'll be extremely useful. By using quickscoping, a skilled sniper can fight close to mid combat, altering the flow of the game.</li>
								</ul>
										
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								
								<h3 class="headStuff">Don't forget your other weapons.</h3>
								<p class="sit">The SMG is adequate for shooting enemies at a somewhat close distance. It has a very fast rate of fire but is quite weak. Use it when there is an oncoming enemy who is too close to snipe. And the kukuri. While, like all melee weapons, the Kukri is fun and satisfying to use, it is somewhat weak and should only be used when the other weapons can't be used or you know that the enemy has low health.</p>
												
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								
								<h3 class="headStuff">Use your brain.</h3>
								<ul class="bulletStuff">
									<li>Always be on full alert! Make sure you often look around you so that you don't get attacked by a spy. If your back is turned to a spy, they can easily backstab you and kill you instantly. Most spies often act very suspiciously so make sure you shoot and attack any players coming near you. Even if your back is against a wall, a spy could easy take out his revolver or just swipe his knife at you and kill you. Use your ears; the cloaking and disguising sound effect of a spy is often easily audible and will alert you or any nearby spies. You can easily discover if someone is a spy if you cannot walk through them. If you can walk through them, then it's not an enemy spy: stop wasting your time.</li>
									<li>Remember that unseen enemy Snipers can snipe you at any time! Additionally, you can mash the WASD keys and walk around and jump around. If you jump (space) and crouch (ctrl) at the same time, you will jump higher than without crouching. In mid-jump, you can tap your crouch (ctrl) key rapidly two times. This will make your character move up and down so quickly that enemy Snipers will most of the time fail to headshot you.</li>
									<li>Support your teammates! However fun it may be just looking out for yourself and sniping only at your enemies, your main goal is to help your teammates, not just yourself! When you see an enemy in combat with one of your teammates, your job is to try to snipe the enemy so you can help your teammate gain points and survive! Don't waste time check for nonexistent spies and especially don't play Sniper vs Sniper minigames. If you only snipe at enemy Snipers, you won't be helping your team very much at all, as it isolates you from the main game (as you are instead playing a 'minigame' of just seeing if you can compete with the enemy Snipers in killing them). This is notorious in maps like 2Fort, where the battlements on each side are used by Snipers to play the minigame, constantly competing against each other to see who's the better Sniper. Avoiding this minigame and actually helping out your team mates can be as simple as going to other sniping positions where enemy Snipers are less likely to see you, and doing something useful such as killing Medic + Heavy combos or helping out in general combat.</li>
