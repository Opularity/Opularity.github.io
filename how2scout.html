						</div>
		<p class="sit">The American flag runners of Team Fortress 2. Having a thing for baseball and a need for speed, Scouts hold an in-game record for being the fastest through their class speed. Saying that, Scouts can capture control points and move payloads twice as fast. In addition to speed, Scouts are the only class that can double jump. Armed with a deadly Scattergun, a Pistol and his deadly Bat, he'll not only capture the intelligence and leave the opposing team confused, he will also have a good time doing it.</p>
			
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h3 class="headStuff">Prepare for battle.</h3>
		<p class="sit">As discussed above, Scouts have a medium-close ranged Scattergun (Primary). Aside from this, he also wields a medium ranged Pistol (Secondary) and finally, the Bat, which is completely deadly for picking at the opposing players' health until death (Melee). The other two weapons are is speed and double jump that the Scout possesses for movement, confusion and evasion. Learn these in a combo.</p>

		<h3 class="headStuff">Use your scattergun.</h3>
		<p class="sit">It is very powerful. It works well in medium ranges and can be lethal at short range. It is stronger than the regular Shotgun. To do maximum damage with this weapon, you have to be up close to your target. Reload this weapon whenever you're out of combat range, and make sure to think ahead and plan your reloads carefully if you have to do so during battle. This could mean popping behind some cover to do so.</p>
		<ul class="bulletStuff">
		
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h3 class="headStuff">Use your pistol for longer range.</h3>
		<p class="sit">Use the Pistol in long ranges. The Pistol is the most accurate weapon the Scout has, and it is perfect for picking off enemies who try to flee. This weapon does more damage than the Scattergun at long ranges. The Pistol also has a very fast rate of fire. You can use it as a second-hand weapon to the Scattergun. To fire it at maximum speed, you should rapidly click the mouse button instead of holding it down.</p>
		
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h3 class="headStuff">Use the Bat in point-blank range.</h3>
		<p class="sit">Use the Baseball bat at point-blank range. The baseball bat can be lethal when in range. It is also very fast. However, if you miss a swing, your plan could go awry. You should only use this on an unsuspecting enemy whose back is turned, or when the Scattergun and Pistol are not available for use. This weapon, compared to the other melee weapons in the game, swings faster, but each swing does less damage, so it isn't like the burst damage of the other melee weapons. Beware if your target is also trying to use their melee, as a critical hit from it will kill you instantly if your health is low.</p>
		
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h3 class="headStuff">Use your speed.</h3>
		<p class="sit">The Scout runs around 1/3 faster than the other classes that run at standard speed. The Scout is also capable of using a double jump to dart around in the air during combat or reach places unreachable to other classes (excluding Soldiers and Demomen). The superior speed and movement is one of the key abilities to his style of gameplay, and you should hardly ever be staying still. Jump around and move in unpredictable patterns during combat to make it harder for the enemy to aim at you, giving you a further advantage.</p>
				
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h3 class="headStuff">Use your jump.</h3>
		<p class="sit">As a Scout, you can, while in the air, jump again to get a double jump. You can reach places inaccessible to other classes (excluding Soldiers and Demomen). Utilizing your double jumps to take small shortcuts on maps can make you traverse even quicker, or get you into advantageous positions (e.g. straight behind your targets without them knowing, allowing you to wound or even kill them).<p class="sit">
		
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<h3 class="headStuff">Use your brain.</h3>
		<ul class="bulletStuff">
			<li>Scouts aren't well known for massive killing sprees. Helping your team through a group perspective, such as capping the point, or attempting to get the enemy Intel, is an area where you shine, as you are specialized in doing these things (Scouts cap twice as fast as other players, and can make great carriers due to their speed).</li>
